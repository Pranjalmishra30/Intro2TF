# Enhancing Vision with Convolutional Neural Networks  

- Introduction to ConvNets and convolution  
- Pooling  
    - Used to compressing images while preserving features  
    - Slide over the image every x pixels (horizontally and vertically) and pick the largest pixel value. Use that info to create a new x by x matrix.  
    - Thus size has reduced and the dominant features were also preserved.

- Implementing conv. and pooling layers with to improve the fashion MNSIT predictions  
- Exercise: Improving MNIST dataset to 99.8 accuracy
